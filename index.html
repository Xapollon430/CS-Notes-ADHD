      >Context: There are some really technical questions that I ask myself
      about computers that I dont know. Not knowing the answers makes me feel
      not good enough as a CS major. So this is my attempt to keep track of
      those questions in my pointless journey in perfectionism. I am obsessive
      and compulsive.

    <h3>
      1- Why cant MACOS and its native applications run on a Windows machine?
      Why cant we develop MACOS applications on Windows?
    </h3>

    <div>
      Answer: MACOS deliberatly goes out of its own fucking way to check the
      hardware its running on and refuses to cooperate if the OS isnt on an
      Apple machine. Thus all the libraries and APIs needed to run the OS and
      any application arent present to develop apps.

    <h3>4- How does Rosetta 2 work? (Or any dynamic binary translator)</h3>

    <div>Answer:</div>
    <h3>5- How does a computer work under the hood?</h3>

    <div>
      Answer: This is a lenghty question, what I want to answer is what is the
      process of CPU executing instructions. When you run an executable, or a
      program that runs constatly on a while(1) loop like a web server that is
      listening. From your hard disk, instructions are loaded into the RAM for
      example LDA 14 might mean "Load register A with the value at memory
      location 14" might be represented as 00011110 the first 4 bits
      representing the instruction and the last 4 as the argument. These
      instructions are called "opcodes" and there are rules on how to write them
      defined by the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) like x86 or ARM. Then
      the opcode will be moved from RAM to the instruction register (the
      register that holds the opcode that is about to be executed) Afterwards
      the cpu clock cycle will "fetch -> decode -> execute" this instruction
      from RAM. The control unit (CU) will look at the opcode and break it down
      into pieces to tell the CPU how to execute this opcode (btw CU is a part
      of CPU, not seperate). CU can be hardwired or microprogrammed using an
      EEPROM (check out question #6). A CPU doesnt "think" it looks at the
      instruction and with the help of logic gates (transistors) it carries out
      one instruction at a time. Whether that is adding 2 + 2 together with the
      help of the ALU, or move the content of a register to another register.
      The CU ,depending on the opcode, will send the data to different parts of
      the CPU through the databus in order to be executed. These "actions" can
      be called "microcode" as this is a level deeper than machine code and
      tells the CPU what to do IN ORDER TO execute the machine code (assembly)

    <h3>6- How does an EEPROM work?</h3>

    <div>
      Answer: Normally when you build a computer you can make it all from logic
      gates (integrated circuits like 74ls08) using
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zffjsXqATg"
        >combinational logic</a
      >. But instead of that we can use a EEPROM (Electrically eraseable
      programmable read only memory) to "program" the logic into it. A ROM is a
      non-volatile way to store bits in memory (unlike RAM). With an EEPROM you
      can specify where in the ROM you want to write 8 bits when you use the
      Write Enable and then later you can read off that using Read Enable to see
      what instructions are in that memory cell. An EEPROM is perfect to use to
      microcode programs that wont be changed often. An OS and the BIOS code can
      be written in the ROM.

    <h3>7- What is firmware?</h3>

    <div>
      Answer: The origin of the word firmware is a mid-point between hardware
      and software - software embedded on hardware. It refers to software that
      it is stored in non-volatile memory (such as ROM, EEPROM or Flash memory)
      on a hardware device, and is used by the device itself.
